# **Fighter Image Classifier Project**

## **Overview**
This project aims to develop an image classification model that can accurately identify and classify images of fighters. Utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN), the model learns to distinguish between different fighters based on their visual features from a curated dataset.

## **Problem Statement**
The challenge lies in accurately classifying images of fighters, which may vary significantly in terms of pose, lighting, background, and equipment. Such variability introduces complexity in identifying distinctive features that are consistent across different images of the same fighter while differentiating them from images of other fighters.

## **Solution**
To address this challenge, we developed a CNN-based model tailored to capture the nuanced visual patterns present in images of fighters. The solution involves several key steps:

**Data Preparation:** Images are collected and labeled with their corresponding fighter class. This dataset is then split into training and validation sets to ensure the model can generalize well to new, unseen images.

**Model Architecture:** The CNN model consists of several layers designed to extract and learn from the hierarchical patterns in the images. Starting with convolutional layers to capture low-level features such as edges and textures, the model progressively builds up to more abstract features that define each fighter's unique visual signature.

**Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained using the training dataset with a focus on minimizing classification error. Performance is evaluated on the validation set to ensure accuracy and the ability to generalize.

## **Implementation Details**
**Data Augmentation:** To enhance the robustness of the model, data augmentation techniques such as rotation, scaling, and horizontal flipping are employed.

**Optimization:** The model uses the Adam optimizer with a binary cross-entropy loss function, fine-tuned to achieve the best performance.
Metrics: Accuracy is the primary metric for evaluating model performance, alongside other metrics to provide insights into areas such as precision and recall.
